My name is Kedir Enrique Lluch Milanes. I've been programming since I was 15 years old.
In middle school I started to learn C++ and involved in competitive programming, been able to win
two golden medals at national level and two bronze medal in the Caribbean International Informatics
Contest (CIIC). With those achievements I earned my scholarship into Havana's University and started
my career in Computer Science. In college I developed all the skills needed for an Computer Scientist.
Never giving up my passion for competitive programming I enrolled in ACM-ICPC and reached into the
Caribbean Finals of the ACM-ICPC 2017.
In my last year in collage Covid-19 struck . The learning model changed, and I realized that the study
program in Havana's University wasn't updated with the most recent technologies so I decided to start a
self learning path and a more customized career, in order to my likes, my vision and my interests. I left
the country looking for new opportunities and improve my work conditions.
When I'm working I'm always looking for a better way to do things. As a former competitive pro-
grammer my philosophy is to solve problems in a simple, elegant and ecient way. I try to adopt coding
standards and the best practices.
Skills:
. C++ (majorly used solving competitive problems)
. C# (main language, biggest projects were made with C#)
. JavaScript, HTML5, CSS
. React frontend development
. Git & GitHub (version control and teamwork)
. python (mathplotlib, numpy, pandas, (. . . ) )
. Assembly
. Deep comprehension of Algorithms and Data Structure
. Solid math knowledge and solving problem logic.
. LaTEX
. Fast learning and adaptation to any technology.
Pro jects I've made:
. Two parsers for customs languages (college subject project, almost a Compiler)
. Basic Microprocessor builded on Logisim.
. Several projects about math applications on the programming science eld (majorly numerical
approximations on statistics, ordinary dierential equations, algebra and geometry)
Non-Related Skills:
. Good Overall Financial Knowledge ( trading and market analysis interpretation)
. Algorithmic Trading
. Used to swim until 14 years old, got several medals. Good knowledge about sport lifestyle and
sport science.
. Good DPS (WoW WotLK), I can tank too.
