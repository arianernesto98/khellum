  My name is Kedir Enrique Lluch Milanes. I've been programming since I was 15 years old.
</p>
<p>
  In middle school I started to learn C++ and involved in competitive programming, been able to win
  two golden medals at national level and two bronze medal in the Caribbean International Informatics
  Contest (CIIC). With those achievements I earned my scholarship into Havana's University and started
  my career in Computer Science. In college I developed all the skills needed for an Computer Scientist.
  Never giving up my passion for competitive programming I enrolled in ACM-ICPC and reached into the
  Caribbean Finals of the ACM-ICPC 2017.

  In my last year in collage Covid-19 struck . The learning model changed, and I realized that the study
  program in Havana's University wasn't updated with the most recent technologies so I decided to start a
  self learning path and a more customized career, in order to my likes, my vision and my interests. I left
  the country looking for new opportunities and improve my work conditions.
  When I'm working I'm always looking for a better way to do things. As a former competitive pro-
  grammer my philosophy is to solve problems in a simple, elegant and eficient way. I try to adopt coding
standards and the best practices.
